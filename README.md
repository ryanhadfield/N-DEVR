# N-DEVR

This app will use the [Strava API](https://developers.strava.com/) to retrieve user data as well as Strava's segment data.  We are using a polyline encoder to display the segment data on a map.  The user will select segments on the map to build and plan their activity.

## Description

N-DEVR aims to help adventure seekers plan out their outdoor activities & endeavors. Our team's mission is to easily allow our active outdoor community to plan, organize, and include friends in outdoor pursuits and goals.

N-DEVR is powered by [Strava ](https://www.strava.com/) and enables it's 50+ million athletes to connect and plan their activities.

Once the user logs into N-DEVR they will be directly to their user profile page.  This page will show the user their name and location information as well as their profile pic. From the user profile page the user can see a list of previously created activities as well as create new activities.
